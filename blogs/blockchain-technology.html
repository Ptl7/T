        <h2>1. What is Blockchain?</h2>
        <p>Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions in blocks. Each block is linked to the previous one, creating a chain of data. These blocks are secured using cryptographic methods, making blockchain highly secure and resistant to modification.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="how-blockchain-works">
        <h2>2. How Does Blockchain Work?</h2>
        <p>Blockchain works by recording transactions in blocks. Once a block is filled with data, it is linked to the previous block, forming a chain. Each participant in the blockchain network has a copy of this ledger, ensuring transparency and security.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A transaction is requested and authenticated.</li>
            <li>The transaction is represented as a block.</li>
            <li>The block is broadcast to all participants in the network.</li>
            <li>The network validates the transaction through consensus mechanisms.</li>
            <li>The block is added to the chain, making it permanent and unalterable.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="history-of-blockchain">
        <h2>3. The History of Blockchain</h2>
        <p>The concept of blockchain was first introduced in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was originally devised for Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. However, blockchain has since evolved and expanded beyond cryptocurrency to various industries.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="blockchain-vs-db">
        <h2>4. Blockchain vs Traditional Databases</h2>
        <p>Blockchain differs from traditional databases in several key ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Unlike traditional databases, which are controlled by a central authority, blockchain operates on a decentralized network of nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain uses cryptography to ensure data integrity and security.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="features">
        <h2>5. Key Features of Blockchain</h2>
        <p>Blockchain has several unique features that set it apart from other technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> No single authority controls the blockchain; all participants have equal power.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All transactions are visible to everyone in the network, ensuring accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Data is encrypted and validated by the network, making it resistant to tampering.</li>
            <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be changed or deleted.</li>
            <li><strong>Consensus Mechanisms:</strong> Blockchain relies on consensus algorithms to validate transactions.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="applications">
        <h2>6. Applications of Blockchain Technology</h2>
        <p>Blockchain technology has far-reaching applications in various industries:</p>
        <h3>Financial Services</h3>
        <p>Blockchain has transformed the financial industry by offering faster, more secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on blockchain technology.</p>

        <h3>Supply Chain Management</h3>
        <p>Blockchain improves transparency in supply chains, allowing companies to track products from their origin to the consumer, ensuring authenticity and reducing fraud.</p>

        <h3>Healthcare</h3>
        <p>In healthcare, blockchain can securely store patient records, ensuring data privacy while allowing authorized access for doctors and healthcare professionals.</p>

        <h3>Voting</h3>
        <p>Blockchain can create transparent and secure voting systems, reducing the risk of fraud and making elections more reliable.</p>

        <h3>Real Estate</h3>
        <p>By recording property transactions on a blockchain, the real estate industry can simplify and secure the buying and selling process, reducing fraud and ensuring proper ownership records.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="types">
        <h2>7. Types of Blockchain</h2>
        <p>There are four main types of blockchain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Blockchain:</strong> Open to anyone, fully decentralized. Examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Blockchain:</strong> Restricted to a specific organization or group, offering more control over data.</li>
            <li><strong>Consortium Blockchain:</strong> Controlled by a group of organizations, often used in industries like banking.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid Blockchain:</strong> A combination of public and private blockchains, offering flexibility and security.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="smart-contracts">
        <h2>8. Smart Contracts</h2>
        <p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically execute when conditions are met, removing the need for intermediaries.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="consensus">
        <h2>9. Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>Consensus mechanisms ensure that all participants in the network agree on the validity of transactions. Some popular mechanisms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW):</strong> Miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. Used by Bitcoin.</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS):</strong> Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. Used by Ethereum 2.0.</li>
            <li><strong>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):</strong> Users vote for a small group of validators to validate transactions on their behalf.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="challenges">
        <h2>10. Challenges of Blockchain</h2>
        <p>While blockchain offers many benefits, it also faces several challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Blockchain networks can struggle with processing large volumes of transactions quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> Proof of Work blockchains require significant computational power and energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Issues:</strong> The regulatory landscape for blockchain and cryptocurrencies is still evolving, creating uncertainty.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="future">
        <h2>11. The Future of Blockchain</h2>
        <p>The future of blockchain is promising, with potential applications in virtually every industry. From improving transparency in business transactions to revolutionizing data security, blockchain is set to change how we conduct business, secure data, and even govern societies.</p>
